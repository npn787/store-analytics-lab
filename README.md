📊 Store Analytics Lab

A retail sales intelligence sandbox for customer-focused businesses

Welcome to my analytics lab where I simulate how modern retail stores (especially telecom & service-based stores) understand customers, track performance, and improve sales decisions using data.

This project blends customer thinking + analytics + automation to demonstrate how a store can turn everyday transactions into meaningful insights.

🧠 Why this project exists
Retail and telecom stores generate data every minute:
- device sales
- plan activations
- accessories
- returns
- customer interactions
But raw transactions alone don’t improve performance.
You need insight.

This project shows how sales data can be transformed into:
-performance metrics
-upsell indicators
-revenue trends
-customer-needs recommendations
All inside a simple, reproducible system.

🛠 Tools used
Python
SQLite
Pandas
Matplotlib

🧱 Project structure
engine/      → data simulation + analytics logic  
database/    → database schema  
insights/    → KPI reports + charts  

🔍 What the system does
📈 Performance Analytics
-Revenue trends over time
-Sales per representative
-Average order value
-Accessory attach rate (upsell metric)
-Returns tracking
-Inventory signals
These metrics mirror what retail stores monitor daily.

🛍 Customer Recommendation Simulation
A simple interactive script simulates a real sales conversation:
- asks about customer needs
- recommends a plan
- suggests accessories
- calculates total sale
This models how a store associate helps a customer choose the right solution.

▶️ How to run
From project root:
python engine/simulate_store.py
python engine/build_system.py
python engine/performance_report.py
python engine/customer_advisor.py


Outputs:
- KPI summary CSV
- visual charts
- recommendation simulation

💼 Real-world relevance
This project demonstrates:
- customer-focused thinking
- sales performance analysis
- decision-making from data
- problem solving using Python + SQL

It reflects how retail environments evaluate:
- upselling success
- revenue trends
- staff performance
- customer needs

🚀 Next steps

Future enhancements may include:
- dashboard visualization
- inventory forecasting
- customer segmentation
- automated reporting
